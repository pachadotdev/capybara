Description: Fast and user-friendly estimation of generalized linear models with
    multiple fixed effects and cluster the standard errors. The method to obtain
    the estimated fixed-effects coefficients is based on Stammann (2018) 
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01815> and Gaure (2013)
    <https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2013.03.024>.
