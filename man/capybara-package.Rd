\title{Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with high-dimensional k-way fixed
effects}
\description{
Provides a routine to partial out factors with many levels during the
optimization of the log-likelihood function of the corresponding GLM. The
package is based on the algorithm described in Stammann (2018). It also
offers an efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects in a
post-estimation routine and includes robust and multi-way clustered standard
errors. Further the package provides analytical bias corrections for binary
choice models derived by Fern√°ndez-Val and Weidner (2016) and Hinz, Stammann,
and Wanner (2020). This package is a ground up rewrite with multiple
refactors, optimizations, and new features compared to the original package
\code{alpaca}. In its current state, the package is stable and future changes will
be limited to bug fixes and improvements, but not to altering the functions'
arguments or outputs.
