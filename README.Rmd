## About

tldr; If you have a 2-4GB dataset and you need to estimate a (generalized)
linear model with a large number of fixed effects, this package is for you. It
works with larger datasets as well.

Capybara is a fast and small footprint software that provides efficient
functions for demeaning variables before conducting a GLM estimation via
Iteratively Weighted Least Squares (IWLS). This technique is particularly useful
when estimating linear models with multiple group fixed effects. It is a fork
of the excellent Alpaca package created and maintained by
[Dr. Amrei Stammann](https://github.com/amrei-stammann).

The software can estimate GLMs from the Exponential Family and also Negative
Binomial models but the focus will be the Poisson estimator because it is the
one used for structural counterfactual analysis in International Trade. It is
relevant to add that the IWLS estimator is equivalent with the PPML estimator
from Santos-Silva et al. 2006

Traditional QR estimation can be unfeasible due to additional memory
requirements. The method, which is based on Halperin 1962 article on vector
projections offers important time and memory savings without compromising
numerical stability in the estimation process.

The software heavily borrows from Gaure 20213 and Stammann 2018 works on the
OLS and IWLS estimator with large k-way fixed effects (i.e., the lfe and alpaca
packages). The differences are that Capybara does not use C nor Rcpp code,
instead it uses the cpp11 and
[cpp11armadillo](https://github.com/pachadotdev/cpp11armadillo) packages.

The summary tables are nothing like R's default and borrow from Stata outputs.
I have also provided integrations with broom to facilitate the inclusion of
statistical tables in Quarto/Jupyter notebooks.

If this software is useful to you, please consider donating on
[Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/pacha). All donations will
be used to continue improving `capybara`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of capybara like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pachadotdev/capybara")
```

## Examples

See the documentation in progress: https://pacha.dev/capybara.

## Design choices

Capybara uses C++ and vectorized R operations to address bottlenecks. Some
parts of the code use dplyr, which allows me to write code that is easier to
understand and it works very well to performed grouped operations.

I tried to implement an important lesson between v0.1 and v0.2: "He who gives up
[code] safety for [code] speed deserves neither." (Wickham, 2014).

I know some parts of the code are not particularly easy to understand. For
example, I initially wrote an implementation for Kendall's Tau (or Kendall's
correlation) with a time complexity of O(n^2). Posterior work on it, allowed
me to solve the bottleneck that computation created, and I was able to reduce
it to a time complexity of O(n * log(n)) at the expense of making the code
harder to understand, but I still did my best to write a straightforward code.

Capybara is full of trade-offs. I used dplyr and dtplyr to help myself with the
data.table syntax, otherwise there is no way to use in-place modification of
data. This is something intentional in dplyr to avoid side effects like changing
the input data. In my research I use SQL because I have over 200 GB of
international trade data, where dplyr helps a lot because it allows me to query
SQL directly from R and just using dplyr syntax, something impossible with
data.table, which requires me to go to the SQL editor en export my queries in
CSV format and then import them in R.

With data.table you get faster computation and a slightly reduced use of
memory. The problem is to understand the code when you are familiar with
data.table. data.table uses in-place modification, which gives me
the heebie-jeebies, but I am ok with it as I am using in internal package
functions that the end user never sees. I think data.table and dplyr are great
tools, the problem is the user that uses one in the same way as some people
use a plier instead of a wrench.

I think with my design choices I accomplished my goal of making model
estimation feasible, and now I can run models on my laptop relying on
UofT's servers a bit less.

## Future plans

I will also work on adding a RESET test to summaries.

This also needs lots of tests. There are a few in the dev folder, but I need
to test with testthat.

# Debugging

*This debugging is about code quality, not about statistical quality.*
*There is a full set of numerical tests for testthat to check the math.*
*In this section of the test, I can write pi = 3 and if there are no memory
leaks, it will pass the test.*

I run `r_valgrind "dev/test_get_alpha.r"` or the corresponding test from the
project's root in a new terminal (bash).

This works because I previously defined this in `.bashrc`, to make it work you
need to run `source ~/.bashrc` or reboot:

```
function r_debug_symbols () {
    # if src/Makevars does not exist, exit
    if [ ! -f src/Makevars ]; then
        echo "File src/Makevars does not exist"
        return 1
    fi

    # if src/Makevars contains a line that says "PKG_CPPFLAGS"
    # but there is no "-UDEBUG -g" on it
    # then add "PKG_CPPFLAGS += -UDEBUG -g" at the end
    if grep -q "PKG_CPPFLAGS" src/Makevars; then
        if ! grep -q "PKG_CPPFLAGS.*-UDEBUG.*-g" src/Makevars; then
            echo "PKG_CPPFLAGS += -UDEBUG -g" >> src/Makevars
        fi
    fi

    # if src/Makevars does not contain a line that reads
    # PKG_CPPFLAGS ...something... -UDEBUG -g ...something...
    # then add PKG_CPPFLAGS = -UDEBUG -g to it
    if ! grep -q "PKG_CPPFLAGS.*-UDEBUG.*-g" src/Makevars; then
        echo "PKG_CPPFLAGS = -UDEBUG -g" >> src/Makevars
    fi
}

function r_valgrind () {
    # if no argument is provided, ask for a file
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        read -p "Enter the script to debug: " script
    else
        script=$1
    fi

    # if no output file is provided, use the same filename but ended in txt
    if [ -z "$2" ]; then
        output="${script%.*}.txt"
    else
        output=$2
    fi

    # if the file does not exist, exit
    if [ ! -f "$script" ]; then
        echo "File $script does not exist"
        return 1
    fi

    # if the file does not end in .R/.r, exit
    shopt -s nocasematch
    if [[ "$script" != *.R ]]; then
        echo "File $script does not end in .R or .r"
        return 1
    fi
    shopt -u nocasematch

    # run R in debug mode, but after that we compiled with debug symbols
    # see https://reside-ic.github.io/blog/debugging-memory-errors-with-valgrind-and-gdb/
    # R -d 'valgrind -s --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes' -f $script 2>&1 | tee valgrind.txt
    R --vanilla -d 'valgrind -s --track-origins=yes' -f $script 2>&1 | tee $output
}

# create an alias for R
alias r="R"
alias rvalgrind="R --vanilla -d 'valgrind -s --track-origins=yes'"
```

`r_debug_symbols()` makes everything slower, but makes sure that all compiler
optimizations are disabled and then valgrind will point us to the lines that
create memory leaks.

`r_valgrind()` will run an R script and use Linux system tools to test for
initialized values and all kinds of problems that result in memory leaks.

When you are ready testing, you need to remove `-UDEGUG` from `src/Makevars`.
