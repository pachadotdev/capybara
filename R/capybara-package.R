#' @description
#' Provides a routine to partial out factors with many levels during the
#' optimization of the log-likelihood function of the corresponding GLM. The
#' package is based on the algorithm described in Stammann (2018). It also
#' offers an efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects in a
#' post-estimation routine and includes robust and multi-way clustered standard
#' errors. Further the package provides analytical bias corrections for binary
#' choice models derived by Fern√°ndez-Val and Weidner (2016) and Hinz, Stammann,
#' and Wanner (2020). This package is a ground up rewrite with multiple
#' refactors, optimizations, and new features compared to the original package
#' `alpaca`. In its current state, the package is stable and future changes will
#' be limited to bug fixes and improvements, but not to altering the functions'
#' arguments or outputs.
